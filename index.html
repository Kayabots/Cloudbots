THink as a website builder please provide boostrap free templates  (with the code to copy and paste into Sublime Text and Github) that are applicable for a start up Education Technology App that is on seeding phase showing investors  the App's MPV to get initial funding. We want the HTML code and website pages limited to 2-3 informational pages that will require minimum maintenance but will provide all the necessary detail info for the users to sign up into App (call to action). The website content should easily catch the attention of target customers from all ages that want to trade their skills, knowledge and content with other users in the community and have the possibility to monetize through tokens and cash payment through the App. THink about digital nomads that want to monitize their knowledge and skills while they are traveling into different places around the world. Also, to incorporate the retail stores (E.g. cafes, basketball courts and other sports venues, tattoo shops, barber shops, etc.) that will be part of the community and pay a fee for sending traffic into their locations that will be the App community members. The App will be uploaded into the AWS Martketplace to sell the Saas to other companies through licensing deals. Provide the AWS Architecture to efficiently generate licensing sells to other SaaS companies. Think from the perspective of the CEO, CTO and first group employees who are launching the App in the EU, US, Central America, and Oman area.
